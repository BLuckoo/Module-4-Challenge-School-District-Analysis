# Module-4-Challenge-School-District-Analysis
#
## This analysis is to determine the compile the data from the PyCity School District Board to determine whether spending per student has an impact on their grades.
## The analysis will be based on a dataset provided by the School District Board which is made up of 8 Charter high schools and 7 district high schools, with a total student population of 39,170.
## An original analysis was completed but the Board found out that there were some academic dishonesty and hence, a new analysis will be done by isolating those cases.
