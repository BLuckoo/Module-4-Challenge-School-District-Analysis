# Module-4-Challenge-School-District-Analysis
#
### **Overview of the Analysis**

This analysis is to determine the compile the data from the PyCity School District Board to determine whether spending per student has an impact on their grades.

The analysis will be based on a dataset provided by the School District Board.

An original analysis was completed but the Board found out that there were some academic dishonesty and hence, a new analysis will be done by isolating those cases.

The analysis will be comprised of the following components:
1. Clean the provided dataset by removing professional and gender related prefixes and suffixes 
2. Removing the reading and math scores of the grade 9 students from Thomas High School, where the academic dishonesty was discovered
3. Calculate the average scores and passing rates of all the schools in the district
4. Identifying the top five and the bottom five schools based on the overall passing percentages of the students
5. Calculating the Math and the Reading scores averages of each grade at each school
6. Calculating the average scores based on spending ranges by students
7. Calculating the average scores based on school size
8. Calculating the average scores based on school type
9. Comments on how the results of the analysis were affected by the academic dishonesty

### **School District Analysis Findings**

- Using the dataset provided by the Board, there were a total of 39,170 students in all the 15 schools.

- A total of 461 students from the Thomas High School were in the group whereby academic dishonesty were discovered and their Math and Reading scores were removed from the data.

- The 15 schools in the district use a total budget of $24,649,428 to serve the student population and the average passing rate is 64.9%.

- Using sorting functions within Python, a list of the top five schools based on overall passing percentages is as follows:

- Using the same sorting principle as above with a change in the sorting order, a list of the bottom five schools based on overall passing percentages is as follows:

- The average scores for each grade in each school for Math and Reading were compiled from the dataset using conditional and formatting concepts. The results are as follows:
